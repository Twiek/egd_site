# Cookie policy

## 1. General information

The following provides the user with general information on what cookies are and what types of cookies exist.

### What are cookies?

Cookies and other similar devices, such as pixels, web bugs, etc. are text or image files that are installed in the user's browser when he/she accesses an online service.

Cookies allow, among other things, to store and retrieve information about the user, their browser, their devices and the user's activity in the service they are connecting to.

### What types of cookies are there?

There are many types of cookies. Below, we offer the user some classifications of these, without necessarily implying that this service uses all these types of cookies:

1. According to the entity that manages the cookies:

* Own cookies: are those that are sent to the user's device or terminal from the computer or domain belonging to the owner of a service, and managed by the latter.
* Third-party cookies: are those that are sent to the user's device or terminal from a computer or domain that is not managed by the owner of a service, but by a third party that will process the information obtained through the cookies.

2. According to the time of conservation:

* Session cookies: are those that collect and store data when the user accesses a service and cease once the user leaves the service.
* Persistent cookies: are those that have a duration determined in time by the person responsible for the processing. The conservation time may vary from a few minutes to several years. They are used to save and recover certain parameters each time the user visits a service.

3. Depending on their purpose:

* Technical cookies: these are essential and strictly necessary for the correct functioning of the service and the use of the different options or services offered by the owners of the service through it. For example, those used for session maintenance, response time management, performance or option validation, use of security elements, etc.
* Personalisation cookies: these are those that allow the user to specify or personalise certain characteristics of a service. For example, to define the language, regional configuration or type of browser.
* Analytical cookies: these allow the number of unique visitors to be counted and an analysis of the use of a service to be made in order to measure the interest of the service or of certain areas of it. For example, an analytical cookie would control the geographical areas from which the highest percentages of users connect, which product or service is most popular, etc.
* Advertising cookies: these are those that allow the management of advertising spaces in a service.
* Behavioral advertising cookies: are those that allow the management of advertising spaces in a service. The function of these cookies is to store information on the behaviour of the users of a service, in order to subsequently display personalised advertising.

4. Other technologies:

* Pixels, web bugs or trackers: also known as tracking pixels, tracking pixels, pixel tags or conversion pixels, web beacons or web beacons are tiny images of 1x1 transparent pixels that are inserted into a service in order to measure activity. Once a certain page is loaded in a browser, this image will be loaded, and this data can be measured. The tracking pixels generally make it possible to find out the path taken by a given user's IP in an online service.
* HTML5 storage: consists of taking advantage of the capacities of HTML5 technology to store in the user's browser certain parameters that can be used to identify the browser of the same.
* Local Shared Objects (LSO): also known as "flash cookies", this consists of storing information without cookies on the user's computer, taking advantage of Adobe Flash Player technology.
* Etags: this is a mechanism of the HTTP protocol that allows the validation of the cache that the user saves in his web browser. This technology is mainly used to save bandwidth, avoiding duplicate downloads of content. However, it can also be used to recognise the user's browser.
* Canvas fingerprinting: consists of the generation of a unique form in the user's browser taking advantage of the technology of the HTML5 web standard to identify the user's computer.
* Font detection: this technique consists of identifying the font configuration of the user's computer to obtain a unique identification of the computer.
* Browser cache: as the name suggests, this technique consists of storing information in the browser cache.
* WebGL: this technique makes it possible to take advantage of the capacity to represent figures in three dimensions of modern browsers to obtain a unique identification of the equipment, due to the different configurations of each one.
